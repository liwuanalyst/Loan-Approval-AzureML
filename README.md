# ðŸ’³ Loan Approval Prediction with Azure ML

A machine learning project built on **Azure Machine Learning** to automate the loan eligibility process in real time based on customer details submitted through an online application form. The goal is to streamline loan approvals and enhance decision accuracy using scalable cloud-based tools.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

Automate the loan eligibility process by developing a predictive model that classifies loan applications as **approved** or **not approved**, using customer demographic and financial data.

---

## ðŸ¤– Model Workflow

Built and managed an **end-to-end pipeline** in Azure Machine Learning covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment for real-time prediction.

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Performed **univariate analysis** to examine the distribution and quality of individual variables  
   - Conducted **bivariate analysis** to identify relationships between features and the target variable

2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical variables  
   - Engineered relevant features to improve model performance

3. **Model Development**  
   - Trained classification models using **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree**

4. **Pipeline Automation**  
   - Created a reusable **Azure ML pipeline** to automate data processing, training, and model registration

5. **Deployment on Azure ML**  
   - Registered the best-performing model  
   - Deployed as a web service using Azure ML endpoints for real-time prediction
